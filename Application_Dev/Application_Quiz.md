To create this quiz application, we'll implement a Python Flask backend with models for users, quizzes, questions, and subjects. Here's an example of a modular approach using Flask-SQLAlchemy for the data models, RESTful APIs for managing quiz generation, and user dashboards.

1. Data Models
2. Sample Routes for Admin and User Functionality
   * Admin Routes
     * Add a New Subject
     * Add a Question to a Subject
   * User Routes
     * Generate a Quiz
     * Submit Quiz Answers
     * User Dashboard Route
3. Setup Database / Initialization Commands
  Run these commands to set up the project:

```bash
# flask db init
# flask db migrate
# flask db upgrade

flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade

```
4. Project Structure
```bash
quiz_app/
├── app.py
├── models.py
├── routes/
│   ├── admin_routes.py
│   ├── user_routes.py
│   └── quiz_routes.py
├── config.py
├── templates/
│   └── index.html
└── static/
    └── style.css
```


This structure supports modular development, making it easy to add features or update existing code.
