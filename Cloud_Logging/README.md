# Cloud Logging - Introduction
* Cloud Logging is part of Google Cloud Operation suit.
* It includes storage fo rlogs, a user interface called the Logs Explorer, and an API to manage logs programmatically.
* Logging lets you read and write log entries, query your logs, and control how you route, store, and use your logs.
* A payload, also known as a message, either provided as unstructured textual data or as structured textual data in JSON format.

# Types of Audit Logs
* Admin Activity --> Logs contain log entires for API calls or other actions that modify the configuration or metadata of resources.
* Data Access --> Data Access audit logs contain API calls that read the configuration or metadata of resources, as well as user-driven API calls that create, modify, or read user-provided resource data.
* System Ebent --> System Event audit logs contain log entires for Google Cloud actions that modify the configuration of resources. System Event audit logs are generated by Goolge Systems; thet aren't driven by differet user action.
* Policy Denied --> Policy Denied audit logs are recoredewhen a GCP service denies access to a user or service account beacuse of a security policy viloations.

# Ways to Analyze logs
Effective ways to analyze logs for different GCP resources and identify patterns:

## 1. Use Google Cloud Logging (formerly Stackdriver Logging)
Google Cloud Logging is a fully managed service that allows you to store, search, analyze, monitor, and alert on log data and events from GCP and AWS. Here's how to effectively use Cloud Logging:

### Setting Up Logging
* Enable Cloud Logging: Ensure that logging is enabled for your GCP services. Most GCP services automatically send logs to Cloud Logging, but you might need to configure some services to do so.
* Log Sinks: Create log sinks to export your logs to other destinations like BigQuery, Pub/Sub, or Cloud Storage for more advanced processing or long-term storage.

### Analyzing Logs
* Logs Explorer:
    * Access Logs Explorer: Go to the Google Cloud Console, navigate to Logging, and select Logs Explorer.
    * Build Queries: Use the Logs Explorer to build queries using the Logging Query Language. Filter logs by resource type, severity, and specific text patterns.
    * Example Query: To find errors in Cloud Functions, use:
        
            resource.type="cloud_function"
            severity="ERROR"

* Log-based Metrics:
    * Create Metrics: Define custom metrics based on log entries. For example, you can create a metric for counting the number of errors or a specific type of log entry.
    * Use Metrics in Monitoring: These metrics can be used in Cloud Monitoring dashboards and alerts.

## 2. BigQuery for Log Analysis
For advanced log analysis, exporting logs to BigQuery can be highly effective.

### Export Logs to BigQuery
* Create a Log Sink: In Cloud Logging, create a sink that exports logs to a BigQuery dataset.
    * Go to the Logging page in the Cloud Console.
    * Select "Logs Router" and create a new sink.
    * Choose BigQuery as the destination and select/create a dataset.
* Analyzing Logs in BigQuery
    * SQL Queries: Use BigQuery's powerful SQL capabilities to query and analyze logs. You can identify patterns, trends, and anomalies by writing custom queries.  
    * Example Query: Find the number of log entries per resource type

            SELECT
            resource.type,
            COUNT(*) as log_count
            FROM
            `project_id.dataset_id.table_id`
            GROUP BY
            resource.type
            ORDER BY
            log_count DESC
    * Machine Learning: Apply machine learning models to log data for predictive analysis and anomaly detection using BigQuery ML.

## 3. Visualization with Looker
Once logs are exported to BigQuery, you can use Looker to create dashboards for visualization.

* Connecting Looker to BigQuery
    * Create a Looker Connection: Set up a connection to your BigQuery dataset in Looker.
    * Model Your Data: Define Looker models (views and explores) based on your BigQuery tables.
* Building Dashboards
    * Create Looks: Build Looks to visualize specific log metrics and patterns.
    * Assemble Dashboards: Combine multiple Looks into a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring log data.
4. Alerting with Cloud Monitoring
Integrate log-based metrics and logs into Cloud Monitoring to set up alerts.
* Setting Up Alerts
    * Create Alerting Policies:
        * Go to the Monitoring section in the Cloud Console.
        * Define alerting policies based on log-based metrics or specific log patterns.
        * Set conditions, notification channels, and documentation for each alert.
    * Example Alert: Alert on high error rates in Cloud Functions:
        * Condition: Metric logging.googleapis.com/user/cloud_function_errors has a rate higher than a threshold.
        * Notification: Send alerts via email, SMS, or other channels.

## 5. Pattern Detection and Analysis
**Using AI and ML for Pattern Detection**
* Cloud AI Services: Utilize Google Cloud's AI and ML services to detect patterns and anomalies in log data.
* AutoML and TensorFlow: Train custom models using AutoML or TensorFlow on your log data exported to BigQuery.

**Manual Pattern Analysis**
* Identify Common Issues: Regularly review logs to identify recurring issues or patterns.
* Correlation Analysis: Look for correlations between different log entries and events to understand the root causes.

**Example Workflow**
* Enable Logging: Ensure all relevant GCP services are logging to Cloud Logging.
* Export Logs: Set up log sinks to export logs to BigQuery.
* Query and Analyze: Use BigQuery to run SQL queries on the log data.
* Visualize: Create Looker dashboards to visualize log metrics.
* Monitor and Alert: Set up Cloud Monitoring alerts based on log patterns and metrics.
* Pattern Detection: Apply machine learning models to detect patterns and anomalies.
